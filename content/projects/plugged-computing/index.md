The "Computação Plugada" project aims to build applications and systems to facilitate the dissemination of unplugged computing activities and computer education, fostering the development of computational thinking skills. The idea is that the applications and systems developed can simplify the implementation of these activities in the classroom, but also allow users, individually or in teams, to complete these activities while receiving automatic feedback.

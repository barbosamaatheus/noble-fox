summary: Computação Plugada Um Aplicativo Android Para Apoiar a Aplicação de Exercícios de Computação Desplugada
abstract: This paper presents Computação Plugada, an application for developing computational thinking skills. Its main goal is to simplify teaching involving unplugged computing activities and also allow users to individually learn the concepts with automatic feedback. The application is easy to use and is built upon the well known Computer Science Unplugged lessons.

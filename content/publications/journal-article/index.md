abstract: This  article  aims  to  present  an  evaluation  of  "Computação  Plugada",  an  Android  application  developed  with  the purpose of making easier the dissemination of unplugged computing activities, thus giving its users the development of skills related to computational thinking. The idea of the application is that it can simplify the application of these activities in the classroom. However, it can also allow individual users to accomplish these activities by receiving automatic feedback. Online questionnaires were sent to students and to computer science teachers who already had experience  with  unplugged  computing.  We  have  also  performed  a  spontaneous  observation.  Its  purpose  was  to identify some aspects such as interest and collaboration of the students of three classes of the first year of high school submitted to the use of the application in the classroom. There was also a semistructured interview with the teacher. The results presented give evidence that the application may be suitable for individual or classroom use. We have observed  that  its  use  in  the  classroom  may  lead  to  more  interaction  between  the  students  and to  collaborative learning. Besides, it seems to be an easier way to apply activities that stimulate computational thinking.Keywords:Unplugged Computing; Computational Thinking; Computer Science Education.

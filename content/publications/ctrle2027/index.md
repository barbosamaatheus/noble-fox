abstract: The Unplugged Computer consists in teach concepts connected with computer science without the need to use electronic tools. This kind of teach strategy has been studied a lot by researchers and teachers since last years. In this article is presented an experience report with public high school students. The experience consists in teaching the conversion of binary numbers by means of Unplugged Computer approaches, in way of promoting the development of student learning, around the premises of computing, in an intuitive way. The results indicate that the Unplugged Computer significantly contributes to the students learning process regarding the assimilation of computing concepts.

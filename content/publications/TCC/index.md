abstract: "This article aims to present an evaluation of the application Plugged Computing, an Android application developed with the purpose of making easier the dissemination of unplugged computing activities, thus giving its users the development of skills related to computational thinking. The idea of ​​the application is that it can simplify the application of these activities in the classroom, but it can also allow users to individually accomplish these activities by receiving automatic feedback. Online questionnaires were made available to students and to computer science teachers who already had experience with unplugged computing. A spontaneous observation was also made to identify some aspects such as interest and collaboration of the students of three classes of the first year of high school submitted to the use of the application in the classroom. The results were positive and give evidence that the application may be suitable for individual or classroom use."

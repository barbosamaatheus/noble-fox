abstract: "This paper presents Computação Plugada, an application for
developing computational thinking skills. Its main goal is to simplify teaching
involving unplugged computing activities and also allow users to individually
learn the concepts with automatic feedback. The application is easy to use and
is built upon the well known Computer Science Unplugged lessons."
